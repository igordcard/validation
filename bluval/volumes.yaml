# Full list of volumes that can be mounted to the containers when running the tests.
# When adding volumes, add file or dir at the end of the keyword to ease identifying
# the type of the volume
#
# When running the tests, fill in the 'local' sections only for the volumes that are
# applicable to your setup

volumes:

    ssh_key_file:
        local: ''
        target: '/root/.ssh'
