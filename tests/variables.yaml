# This file provides variables required by robot testcases
# This file can be passed to robot testcases as follows
# $ robot -V variables.yaml <robot test case file>
#
# All keys are converted UPPERCASE before submitting to robot. YAML notation is
# smallcase and Robot variables notation is UPPERCASE so industry is following
# this.
#
# bluval.py takes this file and updates it to new file and passes to
# robot framework
#
